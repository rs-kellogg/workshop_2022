## R Markdown Installation

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

To install R Markdown, you will need to run the following install packages lines and load library lines:

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# install packages
#install.packages('rmarkdown')

# load packages
library(rmarkdown)

# load additional packages
library(dplyr)
library(plyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(vtable) 
library(stargazer) 
```

## Including Code Chunks and Results

You can embed an R code chunk in the space below.  Note that this line will show you both the R command you used and the results.  

```{r taxi}
# set working environment
setwd("~/workshop_2022/Session6_Export_Results/data")

# read in the dataframe
taxi <- read.csv(file="taxi_backup.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")

# Separate Pickup_DateTime into Two Variables for Date and Time
taxi <- subset(taxi, taxi$trip_time_in_secs > 0) 
names(taxi)[4] <- "pickup"
names(taxi)[5] <- "dropoff"
taxi <- separate(taxi, pickup, into = c("pickup_date", "pickup_time"), sep = " ")
taxi <- separate(taxi, dropoff, into = c("dropoff_date", "dropoff_time"), sep = " ")

# Create a miles per hour variable
taxi$trip_MPH <- taxi$trip_distance/((taxi$trip_time_in_secs/60)/60)
taxi <- subset(taxi, taxi$trip_MPH <75 & taxi$passenger_count < 5)

# Merge Taxi data with Weather Data
weather <- data.frame(pickup_date=c("2013-05-20", "2013-06-20"), 
                      Condition=c('sunny', 'cloudy/rain'))
taxi <- join(taxi, weather, by="pickup_date", type="left", match="all")

```

## Embedding the results of a R code within text 

R markdown also allows you to embed the results of some R code within your text. For instance you can show that the mean of taxi speed from the dataset is `r round(mean(taxi$trip_MPH),2)` miles per second.


## Including Formatted Tables
If you want to include tables from your regression results, you can use the `stargazer` package as shown below:

```{r regs, echo=FALSE}
taxi.mod <- lm(trip_MPH ~ passenger_count + factor(Condition), data=taxi)
```

First, we loaded the package and dataset and ran the regression models.  Below, we create a table for results.

```{r, results='asis'}
stargazer(taxi.mod, type='latex', title="Taxi Regression", out="taxi_reg.tex")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plots, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.margin=TRUE}
taxi.predict <- cbind(taxi, predict(taxi.mod, interval = 'confidence'))

ggplot(taxi.predict, aes(y=trip_MPH, x= passenger_count, color=Condition)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_line(aes(passenger_count,fit))+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lwr, ymax=upr), alpha=0.3)+
  xlab("Passengers") + ylab("Trip MPH")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.  So in this case, the plot or R results printed, but not the code command.

# Creating a PDF or HTML document. 
Finally, when you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document
