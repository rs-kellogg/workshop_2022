Session Two (Wednesday, July 13) - Validating Data, Regular Expressions
Big idea: We all have IMPLICIT assumptions about the data we use.
You should articulate those as EXPLICIT assumptions, which you can test.

Useful tool: Regular expressions to define generalizable patterns in text.
Can be used to extract information from strings by testing for a pattern match
OR
by using pattern substitution, rearrange / reformat problematic strings.

You can use sites like regex101.com for quick visualization of regex patterns.
